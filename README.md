# Project 1 - * Flicks aka Movie Viewer*

**Movie Viewer** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

**NOTE** - Find the main code in the MovieViewer Folder ( Sorry!, GitHub still doesn't make any sense to me )

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [X] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [X] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [X] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [X] User can pull to refresh the movie list.
- [X] Uer can view movie details by tapping on a cell.
- [X] User can select from Now Playing or Top Rated movies.
- [X] Selection Cell goes Grey on selection

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [ ] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [ ] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Just how overwhelmed I feel when I make stuff happen and I have no idea why it is working.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I made the required app but not really sure how everything ended up working.
